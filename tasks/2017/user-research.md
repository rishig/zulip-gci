# GCI Tasks: User research

## Background

This task teaches two skills important in developing almost any product:
user research, and sales.

## Task description

Start by opening up a text file. Jot your notes and answers to the questions
below into this file.  We'll call this file the submission file.

## Prework 1

Think of a product (P) that you like and use, that is not the market leader
(ML). It should be a product where there is a clear leader among your
friends/school/community, in the sense that many people you know would use
ML without seriously considering the alternatives.

It could be a product type instead of a specific product, e.g. if you use a
rolling backpack and most people at your school use a non-rolling backpack,
that would count. But it has to be a product, not an opinion or a belief.

Write down the answers to the following questions in the submission file:

* What is the product? Describe what it is in 1-2 sentences.
* Why do you use P over ML?
* Think of someone you know, who probably uses ML, and who probably should
  be using P. What problem would P solve for them? Is that problem a major
  problem in their life? (If not, maybe it doesn't matter much that they
  aren't using P, in which case try to think of someone else :).)
* How would you convince them that the problem P would address is a major
  problem in their life?

Optional:

* Try to convince them to switch from ML to P. Write down any observations
  about what seemed to work or not work. Don't worry if you fail; it's
  harder than it looks, even if P is in fact the right product for them.

## Prework 2

You don't need to write anything down for this, but make sure you understand
why people choose to use Zulip over other team chat products. We have some
drafts of marketing material at https://zulipchat.com/why-zulip/, which
could be helpful to read (see also the links at the bottom of that article).

## Do the interviews

Find either 3 students (high school or college) or 2 adults that have used a
team chat product before [*]. Team chat products include Slack, Hipchat,
Rocket.chat, Mattermost, Microsoft for Teams, Cisco Spark, Stride, Twist,
and possibly others, but not Lync, Skype, Google Hangouts, or Facebook for
Work. Feel free to ask in "#GCI help" if you aren't sure if a particular
product counts.

[*] Alternatively, someone on a team (company, student group, etc) who gets
at least 20 emails a day from that team, excluding social emails.

Interview each person, following the instructions below. Each interview
should take 20-30 minutes. Interviews must be done in person or over high
quality video chat.

**Part 0**: Write down their name, brief background, and where they used the
  team chat product (e.g. what the team was, how big it was, what the team
  did, etc.).

**Part 1**: Understand their problems.

The goal here is to find the biggest problem in their life that Zulip can
solve. Do not at any point explain what Zulip is (at most, you can say it is
an alternate team chat product); the goal is to learn about them.

What are the top five things they worry about in the context of their team?
(E.g. their performance, whether people like them, whether the team is doing
well, could be anything.) What are the top five things the team struggles
with or the team's leadership worries about?

Don't worry if these seem unrelated to chat. Sometimes they will be, and
sometimes they won't. Examples of things that Zulip can help with are:
* Lots of wasted time in meetings
* Institutional knowledge (someone graduates or leaves a company, and a lot
  of their knowledge is lost)
* Hiring, by making remote work easier (companies)
* Coordinating work over vacations (school groups)
* Feel like you can't speak up in meetings

That being said, at no point should you mention that Zulip can help with
these things! The goal is to understand what problems they have, not to
offer solutions. One danger of offering a solution too soon is that the
interviewee can become defensive of their current solutions.

If nothing seems promising, you can start asking more directly what their
communication system is like, and their biggest problems with that.

Write down the 3-5 most salient things that were discussed, as well as
anything you learned that you think would be useful for the Zulip team to
know. This data is incredibly valuable to us, since often it's hard for us
to get these kind of interviews with people outside our friend circles.

The goal of this task is just to understand the biggest problem they have
that Zulip can solve. If you're interested in learning about the next steps
in a traditional sales process, we highly recommend the book "SPIN Selling"
by Neil Rackham.

**Part 2**: User testing

Zulip is currently hard for new people to use, and we are trying to
understand why.

* Tell the interviewee that for this part of the interview, you're going to
  observe them making an account and using the product for a few
  minutes. They should say their thoughts out loud as they use the product,
  and emphasize a) they should be honest, and b) there are no incorrect
  thoughts or opinions.
* If they are comfortable with the screen being recorded, you should record
  their screen. If they aren't, that's okay too.
* Get ready to write or type. There will be a lot to note down, and it will
  happen fast :).
* Send them to zulipchat.com, and ask them to create an account. The
  organization can be called something like test-[their name], and they can
  use a fake name; that part is not important.

If the screen is being recorded, you only have to jot down
* The things they say, and when they say them.
* Anything they seem confused by.
* A link to the video. You can share videos privately on YouTube.

If not, also jot down:
* Any bugs they run into.
* What they click on. In particular, do they click on the hotspots, and if
  so, which ones? Do they click on "All messages"? Do they send a test
  message (and if so, to Welcome Bot, or somewhere else)?

After 5-10 minutes, or when they seem done, ask them what they think,
whether they feel like they understand how Zulip works, and anything they
are confused by. Also ask if they understand Zulip's threading model.  Jot
down the answers in the submission file.

### Submit your submission file

When you finish the task, save your submission file as a PDF and submit it to
us in the GCI app.
